URL SHORTENER
=============

This is a simple URL shortener that uses a MongoDB to store the URLs and their shortened versions.
Mongoose is used to connect to the database and to create the models.
Node.js and Express.js are used to create the server and handle the requests.
The frontend is built with React.js.
Axios is used to make the requests to the server.


Dependencies that are used:
#Frontend
- axios
- react
- react-dom
- react-scripts
- web-vitals

#Backend
- express
- mongoose
- shortid
- nodemon
- cors


To run the server, go to the server folder and run `npm start`.
This will start the server on port 5000 and establish connection to the database.
To run the frontend, go to the client folder and run `npm start`.
